# Project Euler solutions

[My](https://github.com/singram/) solutions to the programming puzzles on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), just for fun.

All currently implemented in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

No claims made on the methodology being the most effecient or suitable for reuse for another purpose.

### What is Project Euler?

_"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context."_
